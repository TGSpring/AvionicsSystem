# Avionics System Simulation

## Introduction

Welcome to the Avionics System Simulation project! This project is a simulation of an avionics system, which is a part of an aircraft's electronic systems responsible for controlling various flight parameters. This program allows users to adjust pitch, roll, and yaw angles, and display sensor data such as altitude, airspeed, and orientation.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate and improve my proficiency in C++ programming. Through this project, I aim to:

- Develop a solid understanding of C++ concepts and best practices.
- Gain hands-on experience with real-world applications of C++.
- Showcase my coding skills and problem-solving abilities to potential employers.

## Features

- **Adjust Flight Controls**: Users can adjust the pitch, roll, and yaw angles of the aircraft.
- **Display Sensor Data**: The system simulates and displays sensor data including altitude, airspeed, and orientation.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The program provides a simple text-based menu for interacting with the system.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2019 or later
- Basic understanding of C++ programming

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/avionics-system-simulation.git
    ```

2. Open the solution file (`AvionicsSystem.sln`) in Visual Studio.

3. Build and run the project.

### Usage

1. Run the program.
2. Follow the on-screen menu to adjust flight controls or display sensor data.
